    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This quintessential comfort dish features layers of tender pasta sheets, a robust slow-simmered bolognese sauce,
        and a creamy three-cheese blend. The secret to a perfect structural integrity lies in the balance of the meat
        sauce and the herb-infused ricotta, ensuring each slice holds its shape while remaining incredibly moist. Topped
        with a generous layer of bubbly, golden-brown mozzarella and a sprinkle of fresh Italian parsley, it serves as
        the centerpiece for any family gathering or meal-prep routine.</p>

    <p>The preparation process involves simmering ground beef with aromatics like garlic and onions before folding in
        crushed San Marzano tomatoes and a hint of dried oregano. While the sauce develops its deep flavor, the ricotta
        is whipped with an egg and fresh basil to create a light, velvety texture. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked
        until the edges are crispy and the center is piping hot. It is highly recommended to let the dish rest for at
        least fifteen minutes before slicing, allowing the layers to set and the flavors to fully meld together.</p>
